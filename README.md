# MLNW_Predicting_Class_Label
To develop a ML project that follows the DLWP 4.5 workflow

The universal workflow of DLWP 4.5 outlines the following steps, which I will be following using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

1. Define the problem and collect samples and labels
2. Choose the success criterion and monitoring metrics
3. Choose a validation protocol (hold-out...)
4. Prepare data
5. Develop a first underfitting model with statistical power
6. Develop a larger overfitting model
7. Regularize the overfitting model and tune hyperparameters based on your performance on validation data
